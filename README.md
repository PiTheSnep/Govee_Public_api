# Govee_Public_api
This is NOT my work, this is Govee's API, and information that they send about it. 

Govee has a public API that is difficult to find, but does exist. If you go to your account and find the "about us" tab, there will be a link to request an API key. 

  Currently, I do not understand the API, and I don't have the time to figure it out. This is simply just posting the information about the API so that it is easier to find. 
  
  Govee, if you have an issue with this being public and would like it taken down, please message me and I will take care of it. But I do think that this is better as public knowledge.
